composite uFJC scission network
###############################

A repository for calculating network-level attributes for an elastomer network composed of composite uFJCs which undergo scission. This repository is dependent upon the `composite-uFJC-scission <https://pypi.org/project/composite-ufjc-scission/>`_ Python package.

*****
Setup
*****

Once the contents of the repository have been cloned or downloaded, the Python virtual environment associated with the project needs to be installed. The installation of this Python virtual environment and some essential packages is handled by the ``virtual-environment-install-master.sh`` Bash script. Before running the script, make sure to change the ``VENV_PATH`` parameter to comply with your personal filetree structure.
